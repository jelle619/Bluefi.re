      <h1>Postage</h1>
      Sending letters around the world is a hobby I quite enjoy. Over time, I started looking into ways to make my letters more unique, personal and special. The result of this you can see below.

      <h2>Stamp Collection</h2>
      <p>I'm not a stamp collector myself, but I do get stamps printed to be collected â€” hence, the stamp collection. This page provides an overview of all the different stamps that I have had printed. Each series features unique artwork and is a limited print. Acquiring these stamps is possible by giving me a good reason to write you a letter!</p>
